Problem Statement
You want to build an interactive Career Guidance Assistant chatbot application using Streamlit and Flask that leverages a local language model (llama3 via ChatOllama). The chatbot must support three distinct roles:

System Prompt[Role_Prompt]:

1) Counselor: Provides career advice and guidance to students.

2) Resume Advisor: Offers feedback on resume content and structure.

3) Interview Coach: Gives mock interview questions, answers, and tips.


The application should:

Allow the user to select one of the three roles, which sets the chatbotâ€™s behavior accordingly.

Create prompt with system + user message

Display the full conversation on the screen in a clear format.

Provide a responsive and easy-to-use interface for users to ask questions relevant to the chosen role and get helpful answers.
